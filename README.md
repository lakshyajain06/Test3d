 Playing around with 3D graphics
Command click and drag around to pan the camera view. To select a point, left click on it. You can select multiple points by shift clicking. To connect points with a line, select them all and then press f. Press and hold space ot see the points rotate.

Rotate camera has not yet been implemented. Probably will add more customizability as to what is shown on screen. For example maybe allow you to move the points or have a different set of coordinates.
